Description: tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
 Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
 defined using the Compose file format. A Compose file is used to define how one
 or more containers that make up your application are configured. Once you have
 a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a single
 command: docker compose up.
